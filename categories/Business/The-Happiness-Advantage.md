# Success != Happiness

This broken formula states that success will bring us joy.  However, we simply continue to push our goals farther each time we accomplish a new feat.  

> More than a decade of groundbreaking research in the fields of positive psychology has proven that the relationship between success and happiness works the other way around.  Happiness and optimism fuel performance, achievement, and give us the competitive edge - the Happiness Advantage.

# Stats

* Depression rates are 10 times higher than in 19
* The mean onset age of depression continues to decrease logarithmically - 50 years ago, it was 29.5, and now, it's 14.5
* 4 out of 5 students at Harvard are chronically depressed
* Optimistic salespeople outsell their pessimistic counterparts by 56%
* Doctors make more accurate diagnoses, and faster ones, when optimistic

## Cult of the Average

In statistics, outliers are *problems*.  

* Consider training kids to read.  We tailor to the average child, not the faster, nor the slower.

Rather than *deleting the outliers*, we must **study the exceptional**. 

## Negative Focus 

Many positive psychologists focus on the average *and those below average*.  

In the late 90's, there was a **17 to 1** negative-to-positive psychologist ratio. 

However, this leads many to simply reduce or eliminate the negative.  How often do we look at a depressed person and ask "how can we make him optimistic?"  Rather, we say "how can we cure his sadness?"  This is an error.

# Med School Syndrome 

The author had to go to a boarding school for "Wellness Weak."  This entailed talks on eating disorders, sicknesses, and risky sex.  That's not a *wellness week*, it's a *sickness week*. 

Focusing on the negative tricks our brains into believing the universe has **negative patterns**. 

Take med students. Being exposed to constant sickness talk, they begin to believe they have all the sicknesses.  The pattern infects their brains.

The takeaway? 

Let's study what works, not what is broken. 

# Comparison 

Harvard students are all in the top 1% of the top 1%.  That is, before they walk into the Ivory Tower.

> We wouldnâ€™t put ourselves in the same class with or compare ourselves to those who are bold enough to make their own recommendations. Certainly, when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves to themselves, they show how foolish they are.

> A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.

> I like to tell my advisees: If my calculations are correct, 99 percent of Harvard students do not graduate in the top 1 percent.

# Social Aspect

Often, when we're depressed, we shut people out.  I'm guilty of this myself.  Ironically, we do this at the time we need affection the most. 

All those missed calls from dad.  Those angry replies in texts . . . what was I doing? 

> Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God gave you

> Based on my study of Harvard undergraduates, the average number of romantic relationships over four years is less than one.

> Countless studies have found that social relationships are the best guarantee of heightened well-being and lowered stress, both an antidote for depression and a prescription for high performance.
