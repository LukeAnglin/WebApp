## Pride 

Don't let it get you Luke.  As proverbs tells us, *envy rots the bones*.  What are you comparing yourself to others for?  Remember that the Lord treasures you, no matter the circumstances. 

![Proverbs 29:23](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/75/63/2a/75632ad778578075f3f15960168d7a33.jpg)

## Happiness 

* Read more German books!  You never regret that. 
* Don't work *too* hard.  You will be refreshed if you give yourself some breaks.
* Try to be more kind and generous.  Remind yourself that a small sacrifice from you makes an immense difference in the lives of kids supported by Kids United. 
    * While he may be fictional, remember *Lion*.

## Habits

The power of habit is strong.  Use it.  I'm going to start another document on this. 

## Self Talk

I learned today that talking to myself is helpful.  Use words like 'we' and positive terminology, and it *will* make a difference.

## Bible Verse 

> Do not store up treasures on Earth, where vermin and moth may destroy it, or thieves may plunder.  Rather, store up your treasures in Heaven.  For, where your treasures are stored, so is where your heart resides. 
> -- **Sermon on the Mount** 
> -- **Matthew 6:19 - 21**

Like fame, possessions and this Earth are fleeting.  Heaven is eternal.  Live that way.
