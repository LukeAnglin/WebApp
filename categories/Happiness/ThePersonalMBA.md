# Fundamentals 

> Every successful business (1) creates or provides something of value that (2) other people want or need (3) at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that (4) satisfies the purchaser’s needs and expectations and (5) provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.

This requires 

* Market research 
* Marketing 
* Value delivery and operations 
* Customer service 

in that order. 

Additionally, businesses **rely on people and systems**, and therefore psychology and pattern recognition.
