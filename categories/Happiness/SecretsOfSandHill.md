# Background

## Fund Structure 

![Fund Structure](https://www.delawareinc.com/images/limited-partner-vs-general-partner.png)

3 components: 

* Investors (LPs)
* VC (GP)
* Entrepreneur

## Leaving Venture 

Three ways: 

* IPO 
* Merger or acquisition 
* Bankruptcy or wind down 

## Failure 

The majority of endeavors fail. 

# Leveling the Playing Field 

## Asking the Right Questions 

> If you are going to raise money from VCs or join a company that has venture money, the only way to know if that is a good idea is to understand why VCs do the things that they do. In other words, know your partner before you get married.

## Equity vs Debt 

Banks use **debt** while VCs use **equity**

Choose equity when: 

1. You aren't planning to be making money soon
2. The business is risky 
3. There may be long illiquidity periods 
4. You are okay with losing some ownership and decision power

## Convertible Notes 

A VC may lend a company money and say "Pay this back by date $x$, or it get's converted into equity."  This is called a <span class="keyword1">convertible note</span>. 

## As an Asset Class

**Asset classes** are simply categories of investments - bonds, stocks, etc. 

The author admits that VCs are <span class="keyword1">traditionally poor</span> asset classes.  

> . . . the median ten year returns in VC were 160 basis points below those of Nasdaq.  A "basis point" is just a fancy way of saying 1/100th of a percent - so 200 basis points is 2%

## Power Law 

Part of the reason VCs are poor asset classes is because, rather than a Gaussian distribution, they follow a Power-law curve.  

This entails that **a large % of the returns are captured by a small % of the VCs**

![Power Law VCs](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*0gBFnkVvIMSWV2i6rFzxdA.jpeg)

### Self-Fulfilling Prophecy 

Positive signaling from these well-performing VCs attracts the best entrepreneurs, and the cycle repeats itself. 

### Winner Phenomenon

In VC, my papa's quote flips - he says "It's not the good deals you miss, it's the bad ones you take."  Contrast this with VC:

> But failing to invest in a winner means that you forfeit all the asymmetric upside that comes along with that investment.

### Restricted Access

* Only accredited investors (with a small crowdfunding $1M dollar exception, but it's difficult)
* Zero-sum game - never another first round of financing for AirBNB

# How do they choose?

Venture returns are <span class="keyword1">also based on the power law curve</span>

VCs look for the home runs, not a *good batting average*.  Thus, as an entrepreneur, you want to sell your business as **one that could be that home run**, not just one that might be a *good investment*. 

At early-stage, there is *little quantitative data*, meaning:

> . . . qualitative evaluations dwarf quantitative ones

The three prospects: 

* People
* Product 
* Market 

## People 

If there is a great idea, VCs assume other companies will try to hijack it.  Therefore, they need to want to invest in <span class="keyword1">your team</span> rather than other ones. 

> So what matters most is, why do I as a VC want to back this particular team versus any of the x-number of other teams that might show up to execute this idea? 

Additionally, the **opportunity cost** must be considered.  If they invest in your category, they have a conflict of interest to invest in any other great teams that might come along in the same category. 

**Qualities of good teams** 
* Product-first 

### Product-first 

Oriented on a product solving some problem that came up organically rather manufacturing a team to sell a product (company-first). 

> As consumers, we almost can't imagine what we did before these product existed. 

So, sell your product as though people won't remember what it was like before $x$

> Can I conceive of a team better equipped to address the market needs that might walk through our doors tomorrow? If the answer is no, then this is the team to back.

#### Leadership 

VC's want leaders to appear: 

* Able to attract the great engineers and other coworkers they need 
* On a mission 
* Able to attract customers 
* Able to attract *other VCs*

The term to describe such a leader is **egomaniacal** - this guy has to be *so damn confident* in his abilities that he's almost delusional. 

## Product 

Is there a *fundamental need* for customers and businesses to have this product? Has the entrepreneur *done his market research*?

Generally, VCs understand that until a real product is created and tested by consumers/businesses, it will change a lot. 

> In fact, you’ll often hear VCs say that they like founders who have strong opinions but ones that are weakly held, that is, the ability to incorporate compelling market data and allow it to evolve your product thinking. Have conviction and a well-vetted process, but allow yourself to “pivot”

Can't be marginal improvements, must be **massive improvements**, because people are resistant to change. 

## Market Size 

Follows the power law curve again - we need **huge markets**! 

VCs need to hit home runs, so if the market caps at $100M, what's the point?

# LP Structure  

They are looking to seek an increase on their investment that *exceeds some level of inflation* (i.e. not just the national inflation, it might be the inflation of a professor's salary for an endowment)

## Types 

* **University endowments**
* **Foundations** (e.g. Hewlett Foundation) - bequeathed money from a benefeactor.  Required to pay 5% of their funds each year in support of their mission, so a VCs returns must exceed that. 
* **Corporation and state pensions**
* **Family offices** - managers investing on the behalf of a well-off family
* **Sovereign Wealth Funds** - Organizations managing the economic reserves of a country.  Take the Middle East - oil profits go into VCs to diversify them and dilute over-reliance on that resource 
* **Insurance Companies** 
* **Funds of funds** 

## Investment Buckets 

* **Growth assets** 
    * Public and private equities 
    * Hedge funds 
* **Inflation Hedges**
    * Real estate 
    * Commodities 
    * Natural resources 
* **Deflationary Hedges**
    * Bonds 
    * Cash

## Yale Endowment 

Yale's endowment is one of the best-performing endowments to-date.  Why?

### Components

* 72% in **growth assets** 
* 20% in **inflationary assets**
* 8% in **deflationary assets**

### Takeaway

Largely invested ($\approx$ 50%) in **illiquid assets**, meaning they count on the fact that at VCs will relatively eventually **push a venture to an exit**.

<span class="keyword1">Always ask the firm what point in the life cycle they are at.</span> 

* Early fund stage - **less pressure** on the entrepreneur, **more reserves** for subsequent financing, **less conflicts**
* Late - **more pressure** on the entrepreneur, **less reserves**, **more conflicts** 

Additionally, <span class="keyword1">assess the likelihood</span> that the firm can generate more funding based on it's pass success. 

> in the vast majority of cases, your best bet here is to just do reference checks on your proposed VC partners with others in the community to at least get a sense, reputation-wise, for how the firm is doing.

# VC-LP Dynamic 

* LPs are **blind pool** - they have *no say* in the investments of the VC 
* LPs have limited liability
