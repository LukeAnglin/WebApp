3 components:

## Leaving Venture 

Three ways: 

* IPO 
* Merger or acquisition 
* Bankruptcy or wind down 

## Failure 

The majority of endeavors fail. 

# Leveling the Playing Field 

## Asking the Right Questions 

> If you are going to raise money from VCs or join a company that has venture money, the only way to know if that is a good idea is to understand why VCs do the things that they do. In other words, know your partner before you get married.

## Equity vs Debt 

Banks use **debt** while VCs use **equity**

Choose equity when: 

1. You aren't planning to be making money soon
2. The business is risky 
3. There may be long illiquidity periods 
4. You are okay with losing some ownership and decision power

## Convertible Notes 

A VC may lend a company money and say "Pay this back by date $x$, or it get's converted into equity."  This is called a <span class="keyword1">convertible note</span>. 

## As an Asset Class

**Asset classes** are simply categories of investments - bonds, stocks, etc. 

The author admits that VCs are <span class="keyword1">traditionally poor</span> asset classes.  

> . . . the median ten year returns in VC were 160 basis points below those of Nasdaq.  A "basis point" is just a fancy way of saying 1/100th of a percent - so 200 basis points is 2%

## Power Law 

Part of the reason VCs are poor asset classes is because, rather than a Gaussian distribution, they follow a Power-law curve.  

This entails that **a large % of the returns are captured by a small % of the VCs**

### Self-Fulfilling Prophecy 

Positive signaling from these well-performing VCs attracts the best entrepreneurs, and the cycle repeats itself. 

### Winner Phenomenon

In VC, my papa's quote flips - he says "It's not the good deals you miss, it's the bad ones you take."  Contrast this with VC:

> But failing to invest in a winner means that you forfeit all the asymmetric upside that comes along with that investment.

### Restricted Access

* Only accredited investors
* Zero-sum game - never another first round of financing for AirBNB
