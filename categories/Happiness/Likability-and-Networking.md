# Main Ideas 

## People are Emotional, not Logical 

> When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic.  We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity. 

# Networking

## Existing ties 

Using existing ties is a great way to build connections.  Just people one or two degrees out in your network can butterfly you towards a much larger network.

## Criticism, Condemnation, and Complaint

### Criticism 

*Never* criticize others.  It puts them on the defensive and forces them to justify themselves. 

> As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation
> -- **Hans Seyle, Psychologist** 

Additionally, condemning others brings condemnation back to us.  We don't want that. 

> Judge not, that ye be not judged 

Moreover, truly enter the shoes of the one you want to criticize.  Remember the story of Lincoln and Meade - I would've had that man hanged, yet Lincoln refrained.  Had I seen the blood and gore Meade had, how would have I responded? 


### Witholding Anger 

Hoover and the plane - remember what he told that mechanic: 

> To show you I'm sure that you'll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow. 

The Bible gives us similar advice, of course. 

> Be not quick to anger, for anger lodges in the heart of fools.
> -- **Ecclesiastes 7:9** 

Rather than *condemning* when we harbor anger, let's understand that person's actions. 

> To know all is to forgive all 

> God himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end of his days. 


### Appreciation

> I will speak ill of no man. . . and speak all the good I know of everybody.
> -- **Benjamin Franklin**

> A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men


> The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated. 
> -- **William James**

I love this quote from Charles Schwab, one of Carnegie's highest paid men. 

> There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors.  I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work.  So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, *I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.* 
> -- **Schwab**

From the same quelle, we get this diamond of a quote: 

> . . . I have yet to find the person, however great or exalted his station, who did better work or put forth greater effort under a spirit of criticism than one of approbation.

Carnegie even wanted to praise *on his tombstone*. 

> Here lies one who knew how to get around him men who were cleverer than himself 



### Complaint 

Steps to stop complaining 

1. Step back - view in perspective
2. Mindfulness - verbalize the issue
3. Gamify - each complaint, punish; each grateful plea, reward 
4. Channel - vent in a healthy way - perhaps gym **sublimation**
5. Vent - *calmly* voice and verbalize to an outside source 
6. Gratitude
